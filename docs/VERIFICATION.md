# Verification scope

Executed locally: strict TypeScript check, Vite production build, API integration scenarios against the real embedded PostgreSQL engine (PGlite), file-backed persistence after database reopen, transaction rollback, and session revocation. See the bundle verification report for browser execution results.

The GitHub Actions configuration includes an external PostgreSQL 17 service job, but a hosted Actions run and external PostgreSQL validation have not occurred locally. No deployment or GitHub push was performed.

These are functional portfolio checks, not a penetration test, accessibility certification, load benchmark or production readiness audit.

Latest local result: **5 test groups passed**, zero failures. Desktop/mobile browser workflows and logout passed with zero browser JavaScript errors. Preview viewports: 1440px desktop and 390px mobile. The final client build also passed after responsive navigation corrections.
